Who does not want to pee in a public Krul in Amsterdam? Answer: most women. All men do. There are no female-friendly Kruls yet. Once Amsterdam is just as ready for the female-friendly Krul as we are, the app to find them is already there. And this app might just fast forward to this reality.

So back me and realize this revolution.

Kruls are difficult to find. This iOS and Android app will solve this problem by providing a Map of Amsterdam with your location and the nearest Krul.
